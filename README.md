What does this ChatGPT Script do?
When you run the script file, you will be asked to enter a search keyword or topic.

Then, In just a few seconds, this script will search the web for your topic’s latest articles and information. It will extract the top X results.

Then it will create bullet point summaries for you, generate many content and tweet ideas, and provide you with a simple, clean PDF report that includes Openai cost estimations. so you can know how much you are paying for each request.

Understand the script
As I mentioned Before, In order to get the best out of this script, you have to understand how it works and update it based on your own workflows and scenerios.

I made this script as simple as possible, and even I didn’t follow python best practices just to keep it simple.

The app.py file is the main Python script. We start by searching Google for the top results related to your topic.

Then, we loop through these results, extract the articles, and create bullet-point summaries for each one, content ideas based on these summaries, as well as a series of tweets.

Then we calculate the tokens to estimate the cost of running this script.
